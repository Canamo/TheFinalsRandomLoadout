    <h2>Hello There!</h2>
    <p>This little site have been brought to you by Tanamo/Snel or one of the many other names I go by. In addition, I want to thank <a href="https://www.embark-studios.com/" style="color:white;">Embark Studios</a> and my dear friend <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/plopparntv" style="color:white;"><img src="images/twitch.png" alt="" style="width:1.5rem;" />PlopparnTV</a> for the idea for the site. </p>
    <div style="height:1rem" />
    <p>As of now, the site is still in development and I'm working on adding more features and improvements. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to contact "tanamo" on Discord.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting and I hope to see some crazy loadouts in my games going forward!</p>
